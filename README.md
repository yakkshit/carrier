## Project Overview

[**Provide a concise and engaging summary of your project here (2-3 sentences).**]

This project leverages the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Google Cloud to build a multi-agent AI system focused on [**mention the category you chose: Automation of Complex Processes, Data Analysis and Insights, Customer Service and Engagement, or Content Creation and Generation**]. By orchestrating the interactions between multiple autonomous agents, our solution aims to [**briefly state the main goal or benefit of your project**].

## Requirements Addressed

This project directly addresses the core requirements of the Agent Development Kit Hackathon with Google Cloud by:

* [ ] **Designing and orchestrating interactions between multiple autonomous agents using ADK.** [Briefly explain how your agents interact and collaborate].
* [ ] **Building a solution within the category of [mention your chosen category again].** [Elaborate slightly on how your project fits into this category].
* [ ] **Utilizing the Agent Development Kit (ADK) as the foundational technology.**
* [ ] **Ensuring the project can be successfully installed and functions as demonstrated.**
* [ ] **Providing a clear demonstration of the project's functionality.**

## What to Build

Our project falls under the category of **[Your Chosen Category]**:

[**Provide a more detailed explanation of what your project builds. Elaborate on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the functionalities your multi-agent system offers.**]

For example:

* **If you chose Automation of Complex Processes:** "Our project automates the software development lifecycle by using agents for task management, code review, and deployment."
* **If you chose Data Analysis and Insights:** "We've built a system where agents collect data from various sources, analyze it using BigQuery, and collaboratively generate a comprehensive report with key insights."
* **If you chose Customer Service and Engagement:** "Our multi-agent customer support system uses specialized agents to handle initial inquiries, troubleshoot technical issues, and escalate complex cases, providing personalized support."
* **If you chose Content Creation and Generation:** "This project features agents that collaborate to generate marketing materials, with one agent drafting copy, another creating visuals, and a final agent assembling the complete campaign."

Our multi-agent system leverages ADK to manage the communication and collaboration between these agents, enabling them to work autonomously towards a common goal. We have also integrated [**mention any other Google Cloud technologies or frameworks you are using, e.g., Cloud Run for deployment, BigQuery for data analysis, Google AI models for specific tasks**] to enhance the solution.

## What to Submit

This submission includes the following:

* [ ] **URL to the hosted Project:** [**Insert the URL to your hosted project here for judging and testing.**]
* [ ] **Text Description:** This README file provides a comprehensive overview of our project's features, functionality, technologies used, data sources, and our learnings throughout the development process.
* [ ] **URL to Public Code Repository:** [**Insert the URL to your public code repository on GitHub or a similar platform here.**]
* [ ] **Architecture Diagram:** [**Include a link to your architecture diagram image file or embed it directly below.**]

    ```
    [Embed your architecture diagram here or provide a link]
    ```

    [**Alternatively, you can describe your architecture in text if embedding isn't feasible:** Briefly describe the different components of your system and how they interact, highlighting the role of ADK and any other Google Cloud services.]

* [ ] **Demonstration Video:** [**Insert the URL to your demonstration video on YouTube or Vimeo here.**] The video showcases the project's functionality and how the multi-agent system operates.
